# Welcome stranger!

I'm **Ant Weiss** - entrepreneur,  software delivery consultant, musician, public speaker, writer and instructor.

All this in no particular order and in parallel to being a male human being blessed to have a wonderful family and friends! Yes, we all get on each other's nerves, but that's what makes it fun!

I also like to think of myself as a *futurist*, but aren't we all?

I write on a wide range of topics including but not limited to:

* creativity
* entrepreneurship
* technology
* cool hacks
* music
* marketing
* future
* collaboration
* software delivery methodologies
* devops
