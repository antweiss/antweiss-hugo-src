# Nurture over Nature 

A-a-a-nd, we're rolling!
The first episode of **DevOps Shorts** is out! 

I'm so glad that [Tobias Kunze](https://twitter.com/tkunze) happened to be my first guest!
Tobias is the CEO of [Glasnostic](https://glasnostic.com/) - a startup with a unique approach to application resilience.

I first encountered Glasnostic (and immediately loved the post-Soviet reference of its name) due to my involvement with service mesh technology. Their company blog has a number of deep finely-written technical posts on meshes and service communication resilience patterns.

Tobias is a true visionary and talking to him was profoundly engaging.

Listen to the show to learn:
- Why developers aren't the kingmakers anymore
- Why musicians love IT
- The difference between the horizontal and vertical domains of software
- Why operations are a key differentiator

And on a personal note  - I'm so happy I started this! 
I'm learning as I go, loving every moment of it and I believe in the end I'll be a great host.
