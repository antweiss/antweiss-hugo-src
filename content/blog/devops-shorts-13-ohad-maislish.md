# Ohad Maislish - The Revolution of Codified Infrastructure

{{< figure src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQFqQ8W8QzDFlg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0?e=1608163200&v=beta&t=3renkTfpJpOYG_SdNOWTliOl7eg_2DcWnRBbdnDRVgo" >}}

Here's why I was so happy to host Ohad at the show and why his company [Env0](https://www.env0.com/) is one of my favourite Israeli startups of the last year:

Ohad first reached out to me on Facebook - offering to demo their [Infra-As-Code management platform](https://www.env0.com/). He was nice, I was curious and we scheduled a half-hour Zoom call. Ohad talked, I liked the platform, provided some (hopefully remotely useful) feedback and we said goodbye.

Now as some of you probably know - I own a DevOps consulting company [Otomato Software](https://otomato.io). We specialize in cloud native infrastructure and software delivery. 

A week after meeting Ohad I got a call from the CTO of a cool video streaming startup - looking for Kubernetes expertise.
Recommended by none other but Ohad. The call resulted in a very successful, interesting collaboration and a nice profit. And all this - for spending half an hour listening to Ohad!

So no wonder I wanted to spend another 15 minutes listening to Ohad talking.

Listen to the episode to learn:

- How to become the youngest employee at Microsoft

- How the magic of the cloud unfolded 

- If Ohad prefers Pulumi over Terraform

- What's next for cloud infrastructure
