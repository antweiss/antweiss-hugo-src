# J.Paul Reed - It's Humans All the Way Down

{{< figure src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/262/262/0*eGiWNctkWoqMmWCI.jpeg" >}}


Resilience engineering is one of the most forward-looking topics to surface in our industry in the last 5 years.
That's why I'm so excited to have J.Paul Reed as my guest. Paul is one of the most passionate promoters of resilience engineering practices. He's a co-organizer of [REdeploy](https://re-deploy.io/), a frequent speaker on related topics and now also a senior applied resilience engineer at Netflix.
And he's also a great story-teller!

This episode is also slightly longer than usual because in the end Paul goes into what I considered too important to stop him - the distinction between **reliability** and **resilience**

Listen to the episode to learn:

- Why release engineers are the air traffic controllers of IT

- Why it's important to treat humans as humans

- What names Paul considers important mentioning when talking DevOps ;)

- What happens if a reliability engineer and a resilience engineer pick a fight
