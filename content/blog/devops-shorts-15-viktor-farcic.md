{{< figure src="https://mediarepository.codemotionworld.com/img/users/5836.jpg" >}}


Today I'm very happy to have Viktor Farcic as my guest. Viktor is the author of the [DevOps Toolkit Series](https://www.devopstoolkitseries.com/), the host of the [DevOps Paradox podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/6VRDZ6E89JfNY9BCANx70m) and now also the Developer Advocate at [Codefresh](https://codefresh.io)

- Why software engineers are a rare and lucky breed

- How lack of communication skills can make you fall in love with computers

- What can help you love IT again after you've been sick of it

- How impatience and frustration can bring on collaboration (isn't that the devops paradox?)

- Why Kohsuke Kawaguchi created Jenkins

- How to avoid becoming obsolete in the rapidly changing IT industry
