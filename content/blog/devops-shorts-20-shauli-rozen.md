# Shauli Rozen - Let's Just Get K8S Security Done

{{< figure src="https://otomato.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1603705752667.jpeg" >}}


I first met Shauli when he and his co-founders were only planning to start [ARMO](https://www.armosec.io/) - we sat in a small cafe in Ramat Gan Diamond Exchange district and talked about service meshes and network security. Shauli had great ideas and was full of motivation. And it all paid out! Fast-forward 3 years and he's now the CTO of one of the leading Kubernetes security startups. ARMO is also the company behind [Kubescape](https://github.com/armosec/kubescape) - the great open-source tool for Kubernetes security scanning in production.

BTW - we're planning a post with a Kubescape walk-through on [Otomato](https://otomato.io/otoblog) blog. So if you deal with Kubernetes security - it's something to look forward to.


Find Shauli on [twitter](https://twitter.com/shaulir) and on here's [ARMO](https://twitter.com/armosec)
