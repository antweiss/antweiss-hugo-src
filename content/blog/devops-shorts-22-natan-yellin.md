Natan Yellin is the CEO of [Robusta](https://home.robusta.dev/) - a company building an open-source platform for multi-cluster Kubernetes monitoring, troubleshooting, and automation.
If you follow him in social media ([twitter](https://twitter.com/aantn) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natanyellin/)) you'll find that he is very vocipherous about the correct usage of container limits and requests. But from his interview - you'll learn that it's mostly the human experience with Kubernetes (and tech in general) that he cares about.

You'll also learn that he's very bullish on AI and especially image generation. In fact - the image on top of this post (the kinky one with the shorts) was generated by him in [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/)

Actually - he got me so curious that I went ahead and generated a DevOps Shorts image by myself. 
But my result was somehow pretty disappointing.. I see shorts, but where's the DevOps in them? 

Need to ask Natan what his secret is. 

Here's what I came up with: {{< figure src="https://otomato.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/antweiss_devops_shorts_cd6966ba-4aff-4bbd-a769-808fc31809fc-1.png" >}}
