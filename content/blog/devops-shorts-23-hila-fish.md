Hila Fish is a Senior DevOps Engineer at Wix, a singer, and DevOpsDaysTLV co-organizer. She's also an acclaimed international speaker on the topics of both DevOps culture and technology. 


Listen to the episode to learn:

- What's more important - pople, business or computers?

- Why you should think twice before updating a Jira server.

- Why DevOps will never be perfect without a magic wand.


This was recorded before AllDayDevOps where we both spoke.
