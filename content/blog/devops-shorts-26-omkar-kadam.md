{{< figure src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1524943848400912384/P2KONaww_400x400.jpg" >}}


My show features DevRel professionals, CTOs, architects. Everyone somehow related to DevOps and Platforms.
And I really enjoy it when I get an opportunity to host someone who's a real practitioner with fingers on the keyboard. This episode features a wonderful human being of this specific kind.

[Omkar Kadam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omkarokkadam/) is a Lead DevOps Engineer at Cactus Communications and an AWS Community Builder
It's always great to get the firsthand insights from practitioners.


Listen to the episode to learn:
- How DevOps is making developers fearless
- How Platform teams and DevOps teams interact IRL
- What AI can offer to help us get more sleep
