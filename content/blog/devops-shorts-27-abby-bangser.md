# Abby Bangser - The Best Platforms are Built on DevOps Principles

{{< figure src="https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-london/speakers/abby-bangser.png" >}}


I only recently had the honour to host [Abby Bangser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abbybangser/) at a webinar on continuous optimization practices as applied to the [Platform Engineering Maturity Model](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platform-eng-maturity-model/) and now we finally got to record a DevOps Shorts episode too!

Abby is a Principal Engineer at Syntasso building [Kratix] and is also the Platforms Working Group Lead at CNCF. So she's definitely the person I wanted to talk to about platforms.


Listen to the episode to learn:
- Why transition from QA to Plaftorm Engineering makes a lot of sense.
- Why cross-functional teams don't scale well
- What is becoming our main concerns as we build better platforms 


The episode is live on:

- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5mwMb6RKYi8P6DpmL6ch7M?si=Vjew-HY9SC6fSH3WyNneLw)
