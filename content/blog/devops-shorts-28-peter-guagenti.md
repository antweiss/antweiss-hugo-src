# Peter Guagenti - The AI is an Iron Man Suite for the Mind

Today's episode is a bit of a departure from my regular format. And it's symbolic. The evolution of GenAI is definitely changing how we work in IT. The change may still not be very evident but we all know it's coming. And we still need to understand what changes. Beside the StackOVerflow drop in popularity that is.

That's why my guest this time is Peter Guagenti - the President and CMO at [Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/) - the AI coding assistant. Peter has worked at Nginx, CockroachDB and SingleStore, so he has a deep understanding of platform tooling and open source. And today he's bringing the message of AI-assisted coding. And together we're trying to understand how that changes platform and Devops work.

Listen to the episode to learn:
- Why AI changes everything about how we work (in DevOps too)
- Where AI extends beyond code completion/generation
- What's the role of context awareness
- How it changes our creativity
