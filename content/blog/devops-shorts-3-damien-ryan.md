# Damien Ryan: Working Sanely to Deliver Small Bits of Value

For the third episode of **DevOps Shorts** I was happy to zoom with Damien Ryan!
Damien has spent 22 years working in tech, going from applied science through all kinds of build and release engineering roles to his current position - the Director of Engineering at Featurespace - a company that builds Adaptive Behavioral Analytics technology for fraud and financial crime management.

Damien talks about how crazy things used to be in IT and how XP has revolutionized his approach to software delivery.

In Damien's eyes - DevOps is sanity and we just need it to be more evenly distributed.

## Short Notes:

- Damien is referencing Kent Beck's work  - here's Extreme Programming Explained : https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67833.Extreme_Programming_Explained

- And here's a nice overview of Lennon-McCartney collaboration that Damien mentions when talking about great managers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennon%E2%80%93McCartney
