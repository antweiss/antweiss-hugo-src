About 3 years ago when I started delivering my [DevOps Fundamentals](https://www.devopstrain.pro/product/devops-intro/) training I used to refer to a website called [DevOps Topologies](https://web.devopstopologies.com/) in order to explain the different possibilities of applying DevOps to organizational structure.
The creators of the site - Manuel Pais and Matthew Skelton did a great job visualizing and explaining the dominant patterns and anti-patterns of building DevOps-ish teams. 

Last year they published the results of their continued research in the ["Team Topologies" book published by "IT Revolution"](https://itrevolution.com/team-topologies/)
The book was an instant hit. Looks like everybody wants to build great teams!

That's why I was so happy when Manuel Pais agreed to be my guest on this episode of DevOps shorts. Manuel is a Lisbon-born, Madrid-based DevOps consultant and trainer  - but most importantly - a charismatic and inteligent human being.

Listen to the episode to learn :
 
- How one workshop with great trainers can change your vision

- Was [Gene Kim](http://www.realgenekim.me/) hiding in Manuel's office?

- How IT orgs need to change in order to survive in the fully remote world we're heading to
