# Derek Weeks - Exploring the Team Topologies 
### DevOps Shorts E007

{{< figure src="/img/derekweeks.jpg" >}}

This time around I was happy to host Derek Weeks - the Vice-president at [Sonatype](https://www.sonatype.com/) and the co-founder of [AllDayDevOps](https://www.alldaydevops.com/spring-break). The man who started doing global virtual conferences before they became cool.

Derek spills some light on what it was like growing up in the Silicon Valley and what DevSecOps really looks like in the real world.


Listen to the episode to learn :
 
- Why continuous learning is such great thing
