# John Willis - Towards the 5 Elements of IT

{{< figure src="https://itrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WillisJohn_500x500.png" >}}

This episode of DevOps Shorts is probably the most exciting one I've recorded until now!

This time I was honoured to host none other but the great John Willis himself - the man who brought DevOpsDays to US, the originator of the **CA(L)MS** acronym, one of the authors of "The DevOps Handbook" and now - a senior director at RedHat Global Transformation Office.

John is a fountain of knowledge and insight, a boundary spanner - I love talking to him and always come out enriched. 

Now you too have a chance to experience this.

Listen to the episode to learn:

- How this whole thing called DevOps started

- What was the __DevOps A-HA__ of the man who co-invented __DevOps A-HA__

- What are the 5 elements of IT delivery and why the Dev-Ops dichotomy isn't enough anymore.


John is also running this great [fundraiser for the Black Lives Matter Foundation](https://www.gofundme.com/f/devops-quilt)
