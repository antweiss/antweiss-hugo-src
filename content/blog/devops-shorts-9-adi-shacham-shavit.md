# Adi Shacham-Shavit - Quality is Still Too Hard

{{< figure src="https://summit2016.reversim.com/proposals_files/hke2hiyo2ts9tekiqe2i.png" >}}

And our guest for tonight is [Adi Shacham-Shavit](https://twitter.com/adishsh) - previously the R&D manager at such companies as AppsFlyer and Lemonade, now EVP Engineering at an early stage startup called Clear. 

Adi hates wasting time and making the same mistake twice.

First of all - it makes me happy that Adi is a woman - I feel like my show was lacking in diversity - I only got to interview white men until now. :(
    
And - Adi is both a seasoned manager and an ever-learning practitioner - which makes her point of view especially valuable.

Listen to the episode to learn:

- What is really so exciting about software and IT

- The pain a manager feels when DevOps is not working

- What to do when you feel the urge to leave tech

- What is still lacking in today's delivery processes
