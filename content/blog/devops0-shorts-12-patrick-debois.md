Is this the peak of my career as a DevOps show host?!?!

I'm excited beyond words - I succeeded to land an interview with the man who invented the **DevOps** word itself! With the original DevOpsDays orgainzer  - the one and only **Patrick Debois**!

Beside being one of the most prominent DevOps thought leaders of our times, Patrick is now also the DevOps Relations director at [Snyk](https://snyk.io)
