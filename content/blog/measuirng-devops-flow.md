During my recent talk at DevOps Days TLV I presented the 12 DevOps Flow Metrics we've developed for our clients at Otomato.

The feedback was great and I got a number of requests to publish my slides. So we went ahead and created a github pages minisite with all the metrics laid out and explained. We've aimed at simplicity and conciseness.

Here are the metrics: [http://devopsflowmetrics.org]

Feel free to use and comment.

Looking forward to your feedback.
