# We're on The Cloud Native Landscape!

*This is a story about growing together as a community and building a project that matters.*

## Getting into the Mesh

About a year and a half ago I got interested in service mesh technology. A customer needed some advanced routing capabilities and we started looking at Envoy and Istio.
Then - invitations to talk about Istio at meetups and conferences started flowing in. That's when I got excited about progressive delivery capabilities that service meshes enable. I even wrote a Kubernetes Istio canary controller - [BirdWatch](https://github.com/otomato-gh/birdwatch-otomator).

## Finding Meshery

Digging deeper into what service meshes had to offer I discovered [Meshery](https://meshery.io) - the universal service mesh management plane. And immediately joined [Layer5](https://layer5.io) - the great, welcoming open-source community that created it. 

## Community Matters

Being a member of [Layer5](https://layer5.io) was one of the nicest community experiences I've ever had. Mainly thanks to community's founder and captain - [Lee Calcote](https://twitter.com/lcalcote). He always makes sure everybody feels significant, included and motivated to participate. And this spirit spreads out to all community activities.

In no time I had my first commits approved and merged and started joining weekly community and development video call.

## We're on CNCF Landscape!

Now - I won't be reviewing [Meshery](https://meshery.io) in this post. I've spoken about it in [this video](https://youtu.be/MXQV-i-Hkf8) and some great introductory articles by community members can be found [here](https://medium.com/better-programming/use-meshery-to-configure-compare-and-operate-service-mesh-88f23dbf0b74) and [here](https://www.learncloudnative.com/blog/2020-03-12-meshery-service-mesh-management-plane/).

This post is more of a celebration - because last week [Meshery](https://meshery.io) finally got featured in the CNCF landscape 'Service Mesh' category! 
And this is only the first step - there's already an application filed for [Meshery](https://meshery.io) to become a full-fledged CNCF sandbox project. I had a chance to collaborate on the sandbox proposal and am *so* eager for this to happen.

## Get into the Mesh Pit

This is also an invitation to participate - [Meshery](https://meshery.io) is a young, ambitious project - it requires a ton of work to make it what it aims to become. Integrating with all of the leading service mesh solutions asks for extensive expertise. In many areas [Meshery](https://meshery.io) still sucks. But these are normal growth stages, aren't they? To put it simple - the community and the project need more hands! And these should be your hands!

As already mentioned - [Layer5](https://layer5.io) is a very welcoming bunch!

## Become a Cloud Native Hero

Open source contributions are a must-do for becoming a true cloud native hero. Cloud native is all about the community and one can't be a part of a community by only taking and never giving back.

So if you were looking for a promising and welcoming project to join - look no further! Hop on to [Layer5 Slack](https://layer5io.slack.com/) and we'll happily embrace you and help you get started.

And it's not only coding! Documentation, testing, UI design, logos, blogs, videos - you decide where to apply your talent.

For example - I sometimes wish I had more time and motivation to code new [Meshery](https://meshery.io) features or fix existing bugs. But instead I'm writing this post. Because lately I enjoy writing texts more than coding. Coding for longer than a couple of days at a time throws me into a coding fatigue... Actually also many other activities do. I'm just not very good at keeping a routine. But I'm sure many of you out there aren't like me. So why not join forces? 

## Sum It All Up

- [Meshery](https://meshery.io) is an exciting opportunity to learn more about service meshes

- We're already on CNCF landscape and are headed for the sandbox

- Now is a great time to hop on board

Are you ready? Get into the mesh pit!
