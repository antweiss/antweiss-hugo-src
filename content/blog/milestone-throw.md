Not surprisingly this blog isn't getting too much of my attention.
Most of my writing is now around [Otomato](http://otomato/link) official blog, evangelism we do for [Codefresh](http://codefresh.io), white papers and articles.
Oh yes and conference proposals. I've submitted quite a few lately. There's one talk and a workshop already confirmed for start of December in Munich at [DevOpsCon](http://devopsconference.de) and hopefully there are more to come.

I hope to be able to write more in the next few weeks as we're going on a family trip in the US - which means I won't be doing the day-to-day work for almost a month.
I already see myself sitting down to record my thoughts after a long day of sightseeing. But we'll see how it all works out.

The last month before vacation was hectic.
A lot of projects running in parallel, a few workshops, and in general - I laid off the vacation for too long. Don't do that to yourself - giving yourself some time to rest and reflect is vitally important for your emotional, physical and spiritual well-being.

So now I'm going to recharge my batteries and come back with a blast.

Wishing the same to you.
