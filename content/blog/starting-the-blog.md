If you've been reading the posts on [otomato](http://otomato.link/otoblog-2/) blog  - you know that until now it was a mixed bag of professional articles, technical tips and personal impressions.

Now that [Otomato](http://otomato.link) is becoming a full-blown consulting firm I feel it's time to separate the personal from the professional.

There still may be some shared context here and there, but starting today I'm moving my personal blogging to a Hugo-based site hosted on Github pages (here)
